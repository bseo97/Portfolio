All the warnings in the w3c nu html checker is about the self-closing tag.
But I used react framework, where every element must be explicitly closed "<tag/>".
I can change from "<tag/>" to "<tag></tag>", however, it is unnecessary and does not improve my current react project
Therefore, I decided to treat them as harmless warnings.
